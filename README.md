# Walkability Analysis of Almaty: Intersection Count Approach 🏙️

This project analyzes the walkability of Almaty, Kazakhstan using intersection density as a proxy. The more connected and dense the intersections, the more walkable the area tends to be.

## 📊 Methodology

We used OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to extract all street intersections within Almaty's boundaries. The analysis includes:

- Counting all pedestrian-accessible intersections
- Aggregating intersections per spatial grid (e.g., 250m or 500m)
- Mapping and visualizing hotspot areas

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- OSMnx
- Pandas
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📍 Why It Matters

Urban walkability is a key factor in sustainable city planning. By identifying areas with low intersection density, we can:

- Pinpoint zones that need better street connectivity
- Improve accessibility and pedestrian experience
- Contribute to healthier, more livable cities
